Rewrite JSON

Import Json Manager to VRRoom
Delete VRMenu Version 1 from VR3
Implement JSON in VR3:
(Read from persistentDP in RoomManager instead of BoxConfig Object)
    Check that PDT is reading:
        C:\Users\RMS VR\AppData\LocalLow\UACh\VRMenu\Config.json
    Load Utils into Organizer class
    Make RoomManager call Organizer.JsonRead()
    Get locals from Json file
